<p>Please deploy your application on CS3, and upload all source files to CSNS. The source files should include all the source code, documentation (optional), and an HTML file <em>hw1.html</em> which contains a hyperlink to your application on the CS3 server.

<p>[CS Jobs]</p>

<p>The CS Department plans to hire one new faculty per year in the next few years. Usually one position would attract around 100 applicants, and reviewing so many applications can be quite time-consuming. In this assignment you are going to implement a web application called <em>CS Jobs</em> that helps the department to post job announcements and manage job applications. Your implementation must use Servlet, JSP, and the MVC architecture. The data can be stored in application scope, i.e. you do not need to use database for this assignment. Note that no&nbsp;scripting elements are&nbsp;allowed in JSP pages.</p>

<p>CS Jobs has two separate interfaces. The admin interface is used by the department to post job announcements, and the applicant interface is used by the applicants to submit their application.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>CS Jobs</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">For Administrators</a> | <a href="#">For Applicants</a></p>

<p>Clicking on <em>For Administrators</em> takes a user to the admin interface where current job openings are displayed. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><a href="#">CS Jobs</a> &gt; Admin</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">Post New Job Opening</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Job</th>
			<th scope="col">Posted On</th>
			<th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Instructor for CS320 in Fall 2015</td>
			<td>6/21/2015</td>
			<td><a href="#">View Applicants</a></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Full-time Tenure Track Position</td>
			<td>3/20/2015</td>
			<td><a href="#">View Applicants</a></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>The job openings should be displayed in reverse chronological order with the most recent job opening on top. The dates should be in the format M/d/yyyy, and the title row serves as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_%28navigation%29">breadcrumb</a>, i.e. clicking on <em>CS Jobs</em> should take the user back to the starting page of the application. Note that these requirements apply to the rest of the application as well.</p>

<p>Clicking on <em>Post New Job Opening</em> should take the user to a page where a new job opening can be posted. For example:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><strong><a href="#">CS Jobs</a> &gt; <a href="#">Admin</a> &gt; New Job Opening</strong></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row" style="text-align: right;">Job:</th>
			<td><input name="name" type="text" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan="2" scope="row" style="text-align: right;"><input name="post" type="submit" value="Post" /></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Clicking on <em>View Applicants </em>should display the applicants who applied for the job:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><strong><a href="#">CS Jobs</a> &gt; <a href="#">Admin</a> &gt; Applicants</strong></p>

<p><strong>Job Position:</strong> Full-time Tenure Track Position</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Applicant</th>
			<th scope="col">Applied On</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="#">John Doe</a></td>
			<td>4/5/2015</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="#">Jane Doe</a></td>
			<td>3/29/2015</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>And clicking on an applicant shows the applicant&#39;s information. For example:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><strong><a href="#">CS Jobs</a> &gt; <a href="#">Admin</a> &gt; Applicant</strong></p>

<p><strong>Job Position:</strong> Full-time Tenure Track Position</p>

<p><strong>Applicant</strong>: John Doe</p>

<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">Degree</th>
			<th scope="col">University</th>
			<th scope="col">Year</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Ph.D. in Computer Science</td>
			<td>UCLA</td>
			<td>2014</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MS in Computer Science</td>
			<td>UCLA</td>
			<td>2011</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BS in Computer Science</td>
			<td>CSULA</td>
			<td>2009</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>As for the applicant interface, it is up to you to design an intuitive and efficient user interface where an applicant can apply for one or more job openings. Each application should include the applicant&#39;s name and a list of degrees that applicant obtained. The degrees must be entered one at a time, and each degree consists of a name, the university and the year in which the degree was awarded. For simplicity we will assume that applicant names are unique so there won&#39;t be two applicants with the same name applying for the same job.</p>
